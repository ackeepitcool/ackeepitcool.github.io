          <p>KNODE was created as part of a UX Hackathon event by myself, Alyssa Esteban, Anthony Virey, Ben Booker, and Boris Yu. The goal of the Hackathon was to design a product that redesigned the candidate experience. Ben Booker researched user flows while Anthony Virey researched market analysis. I handled research insights through previous articles and research done on the job market. Boris Yu designed our wireframes, while Alyssa Esteban was our project manager and overall UI designer.
          <br/>
          <br/>The event was hosted by JET and took place on 04.29.2017 at the JET Headquarters in Hoboken, NJ.
          <br/>
          <br/>More information on the Hackathon can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/iq19w2">here</a>.
          <br/>
          <br/>Judges at the UX Hackathon were Juan Sanchez (Director of UX, Jet.com), Travis Kessel (Head of Recruiting, Jet.com) and Sean Echevarria (Product and Research Manager, Jet.com).
          <br/>
          <br/>Team KNODE placed with special recognition in 4th place.</p>

          <p>KNODE was a very interesting and enlightenting experience as a whole. I learned how to cooperate on a team, specifically as a researcher, while other members handled other aspects of the design process. Having this event be a Hackathon was also a very interesting learning experience, as a full scale project was not possible for some parts of the process.
          <br/>
          <br/>Some of the pros I took away from this Hackathon:
          <br/>
          <br/>Team Dynamic - everyone has a set part: researcher, UI, wireframing, etc.
          <br/>Time is collectively spent in a much more efficient manner than individually.
          <br/>Not only does the Hackathon push a team to be more creative, but it also teaches a team to effectively manage their time better.
          <br/>
          <br/>Some of the cons I took away from this Hackathon:
          <br/>
          <br/>Time limitations - as you can tell from my case study, we did not have enough time to have effective personal user research or any user testing. We simply ran out of time to do either.
          <br/>Team Dyanmic - while having all members of the team be equally self motivated and driven, that is unfortunately not the case in a lot of situations. It was challenging to keep people focused, especially given the relative newbness some of us were to the design process.
          <br/>
          <br/>Some things I would have changed had I had this as a full project:
          <br/>
          <br/>I definitely would have spent more time getting some personal user research in. While we made do with the research articles and user testing on millennial job market conducted in published papers, I would have liked to have gotten some personalized user surveys and responses filled out. I also would have loved to have gotten some user testing in, as one of the reasons why we placed 4th was because we had no user testing to back up our product.
          <br/>
          <br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this experience. I felt like I learned a lot about working on a UX team and how to efficiently manage my time, a skill that I carried into the rest of my Bloc program.</p>
